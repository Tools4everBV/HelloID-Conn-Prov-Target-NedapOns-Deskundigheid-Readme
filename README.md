> [!IMPORTANT] Upgrade Warning
> This V2 version of the connector has new names for the columns in the Education.csv mapping file. Make sure to change that accordingly in your Education.csv file when upgrading. A example can be found in the Asset folder.

> [!IMPORTANT] Upgrade warning!
> **Since the June 12, 2025 update, the way the Account Reference is stored has changed.**
> To upgrade from an existing V2 version to this version, should be performed in HelloID along with the "Update all Accounts" action to convert the Account Reference to the new format. If no force update is performed, reconciliation cannot match the existing account in HelloID with the one in Nedap. *See more: [Account Reference Conversion](#account-reference-conversion)*

## Introduction
This repository only contains the documentation. The source code can be found in a private repository and is only meant for internal use. Link to Repository: [Nedap Ons Deskundigheid](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-NedapONS-Deskundigheid)

Nedap Ons provides an API and XML import method to programmatically interact with its services and data. This connector only correlates a HelloID person with one or more employee accounts in Nedap Ons and updates the `Education` (deskundigheid). It updates the education of all the accounts from the contracts in the conditions.

### Correlation configuration

The correlation configuration is used to specify which properties will be used to match an existing account within _NedapOns-Employee_ to a person in _HelloID_.

| Setting                   | Value                    |

| Person correlation field  | `ExternalId`             |
| Account correlation field | `_outputInfo.externalId` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Correlation should be enabled even when no direct person properties are used for correlation in the account Life Cycle. The correlation properties are solely used for the import and reconciliation. [See remark EmployeeNumber](#employeenumber).

> [!TIP]
> _For more information on correlation, please refer to our correlation [documentation](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/target-systems/powershell-v2-target-systems/correlation.html) pages_.

### Available lifecycle actions

The following lifecycle actions are available:

| Action             | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| create.ps1         | Updates the Education of the associated Nedap accounts based on the contracts in condition from the Business Rules. |
| configuration.json | Contains the connection settings and general configuration for the connector.                      |
| fieldMapping.json  | Defines mappings between HelloID (person) fields and target system account fields.                 |
| import.ps1         | Import the existing account from Nedap *(Configurable by active) *                                 |

### Field mapping

The field mapping can be imported using the `_fieldMapping.json` file.

In addition to the field mapping, some properties require extra mappings that are not included in the file. These properties are added directly in the code:
- `MutationAction`
- `Contract`
- `Education`


#### The Primary Contract Calculation foreach employment
The primary contract calculation is the same as the HelloID primary contract calculation. Note that the order of properties can be adjusted to meet the customer's requirements.

```Powershell
## Configuration
# Primary Contract Calculation foreach employment
$firstProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.Details.Fte };             Descending = $true  }
$secondProperty = @{ Expression = { $_.Details.HoursPerWeek };    Descending = $true  }
$thirdProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.Details.Sequence };        Descending = $true  }
$fourthProperty = @{ Expression = { $_.EndDate };                 Descending = $true  }
$fifthProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.StartDate };               Descending = $false }
$sixthProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.ExternalId };              Descending = $false }

# Priority Calculation Order (High priority -> Low priority)
$splatSortObject = @{
    Property = @(
        $firstProperty,
        $secondProperty,
        $thirdProperty,
        $fourthProperty,
        $fifthProperty,
        $sixthProperty)
}
```

#### Script Mapping lookup values
```Powershell
# Lookup value which is used in the mapping to determine the education (Deskundigheid)
$educationPrimaryLookupKey   = { $_.Title.ExternalId }      # Mandatory
$educationSecondaryLookupKey = { $_.Department.ExternalId } # Not Mandatory
```

## Remarks
### One Create/update script
The script used for updating is identical to the script used for creating.

### Correlation

Because Nedap contains multiple accounts per HelloID person (contract), accounts are correlated based on a custom contract property called `custom.NedapOnsIdentificationNo`. An example of this can be found in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. This approach is necessary because HelloID does not support correlation based on contract properties.

> [!TIP] The import and reconciliation functionality uses the correlation directly on the Person property. [See remark Import](#import)

### Primary Contract
Since the connector supports multiple accounts for a single HelloID person (per contract), the default primary contract calculation may not always be applicable. The connector includes an example of a primary contract calculation that determines the primary contract for each employment in Nedap.

### IO Import validation
When updating an employee account, it's not possible to directly verify whether the _Deskundigheid_ has been successfully updated in Nedap. To confirm this, you need to check the_ Import Report_ in the Nedap UI by going to: _Beheer > Import > Importrapportage inzien._

### Preview Mode
Note that in preview mode (DryRun), all HelloID contracts of a Person are in scope. Therefore, it does not simulate the actual outcome when it comes to determining which account should be created, updated, or deleted. However, this DryRun mode is added to verify if the mapping, configuration settings, etc. are present and correct. The contracts in scope are normally configured in the business rules. This cannot be stimulated in Preview.

### OutputInfo
In the field mapping, some properties have a `_outputInfo` prefix. These properties are **only** used to return data from the connector, and the information is visible in the account data or in the notification. Since there can be multiple accounts, the connector returns the values as comma-separated strings. Note that there is **no link** between the individual values.
- Education
- NedapOnsIdentificationNo
- externalId *(Only used in Import.ps1)*

### Always Update
The Update action always updates because the current education (Deskundigheid) on the Nedap account cannot be retrieved.

### Account Reference Conversion
To support Nedap Account import scripts, the account reference object has been changed to a HashTable. Previously, the account reference was stored as an array. If you already have a Nedap Deskundigheid V2 version running, you can click "Update all Accounts" and run an Enforcement. This will convert the "old" account references to the current format.

## Mapping Remarks
### Example mappings
Example mappings can be found in the Assets folder.

### Mapping Type
The connector is built containing a single property which cannot be mapped directly from the person model in HelloID. So there is a mapping file required. This file must include a mapping between HR departments and/or function to a Nedap Education. The actions of the connector fails, when there is no mapping found.

## Governance Remarks
The Nedap connector supports importing Nedap employee accounts, and the import functionality can be used as normal. However, there are some important remarks to keep in mind, see the  [Import](#import) remarks section for details.

### Import
#### Already linked accounts
The import only detects users without an existing linked Nedap account in HelloID. Users who already have a linked account and receive additional Nedap accounts won’t appear in the entitlement import. Therefore, the import script is primarily intended for initial implementation.

#### EmployeeNumber
To perform person correlation, the IdentificationNo is split on the dash (-) to extract the employee number. This differs from the approach used in the Account Lifecycle, where a custom property combining the employee number and contract number is used to correlate individual accounts.

To store the employee number, the `_outputInfo.externalId` property is used in the field mapping. Please note that this field is only used by the import script.

#### Import configuration
The import scripts include configuration options for which accounts to retrieve. By default, all accounts are retrieved and shown in the import overview, but you may want to exclude past accounts. This can be done by toggling `ImportOnlyActiveEmployees`, which retrieves only accounts with active contracts.

The `ImportOnlyActiveEmployees` toggle also enables additional settings to expand the range of active contracts considered, using `daysBeforeContractStartDate` and `daysAfterContractEndDate`. These values can be adjusted in the configuration.

#### Account access
Account access is not used in the Nedap Employee Connector; therefore, no `Account Access` entitlements will be granted.

#### Import Entitlement (Value Education)
The Nedap API does not support retrieving the Education value, this value cannot be imported directly. However, this is handled automatically during the update process, which is triggered after accounts are correlated by the import actions.

### Reconciliation
Reconciliation for Nedap cannot be fully used because there is a one-to-many relationship between a HelloID person and Nedap accounts. Due to the risk of unwanted account deletions, reconciliation should be used only as a reporting tool to compare HelloID against Nedap. The deletion action is not used, but creating accounts is still possible—although this is not yet fully supported.

#### Notification
Reconciliation does not support custom or built-in events when deleting accounts through reconciliation.

#### Account loop
Due to multiple accounts per HelloID person, old (unmanaged) accounts cause managed persons in HelloID to repeatedly appear in each report because of mismatches between accounts managed by HelloID and those still existing in Nedap. You cannot exclude the person entirely since they are still in scope, but only some of their accounts are not. Additionally, excluding accounts at this level is not possible.

To minimize this issue, you are able to filter in the import script to retrieve only active accounts. See [Import configuration](#import-configuration)
